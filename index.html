    <h3> Creative statement: </h3>
    <p> I invite the viewer to see work created by the common man. To see work that, rather than invoke new feelings
        into the person, instead forces them to reconsider past feelings that they otherwise regarded as “useless” or
        “junk”. I try(and notability sometimes fails) to use simplicity and mundaneness in my works, but even in my
        failures, I see the true art of my work blossom. I'm not perfect, nor do i feel human and yet i hope my works
        can inhibit human feelings that i myself struggle to convey in daily life...other than laughing at my faults </p>
