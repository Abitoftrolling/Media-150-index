    <h2> “In Plato's Cave” from On Photography by Susan Sontag self-reflection </h2>
    <p> When I think of the current world of photography and how I can “properly” contribute to image making as a whole
        in the current worldscape we live in, I think of when susan sontag mentions how photographs actively promote
        nostalgia. Zeroing in on this part of the introduction, the concept of nostalgic moments that are created out of
        photographs is something that was known to me, but regarded as hated. Photos aren’t something that I personally
        regarded as “important” in my life because of the sheer amount that my parents would force me to take over the
        years. As I took more pictures, the significance of photography growing up dwindled as rather than thinking of
        it as something that could reveal hidden importance to me, It looked more so as a stain in an otherwise perfect
        moment. Why would you need to take pictures during important moments of your life rather than living them out to
        the fullest. Why would you interrupt the present of your life to take a snapshot of the current.
        Unfortunately(or fortunately for people that aren’t in the same boat as me), those snapshots of life define what
        you become down the road and allow people to look back to fond memories that they had in past events. It's even
        more important now that AI generation is a thing and pictures of fake events and <em>memories</em> can be
        created; Memories of things that never happened, memories of events that you weren’t a part of, memories of
        people that never recognized you. I personally think the best way to contribute to photography is to not make
        one at all and yet without those photographs being shot, you can falsify your life to make it seem as if you had
        real experiences even though you haven’t. If I had one reason to help with the world of photography it would be
        this: I want the removal of false memories. The removal of lies of a life that is unattainable through corrupted
        images. I would represent through my work a life of <em>pureness</em>. Not pureness like that of a newborn,
        pureness that allows for mistakes and hardships. Pureness that allows misguidedness and faults in people because
        without those traits, are we really human?</p>
    <p> Another thing Sontag mentions that is related to the point of false memories, is when she speaks on the Korean
        war, pointing out that Americans would be less inclined to agree with the war if they saw the photos of the
        destruction of Korea due to the war. This is something that also accords with ai photography(if you can even
        call it that): false detailing of events. Someone can as easily create an AI image and consider it as fact; in
        that same vein, anyone can call human art “AI” to undermine its importance as fact. Although one approach is to
        blame the general populace for continuously falling for these lies, the continuous improvement of ai has to
        shoulder the blame as well. Overall, we cannot blame the population for not creating memories on their own and
        relying on AI to do it for them. Instead of criticizing, we can instead learn to help them with photographs of
        our own to teach them the value of the picture.</p>
